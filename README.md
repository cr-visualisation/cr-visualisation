# US Christian right spending visualisation

This visualisation uses `vue-cli`. It is MIT-Licensed, so feel free to make changes to the software as you see fit!

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Compiling

Run the visualisation in development mode (starts a server and reloads as you make changes to the code):

```
npm run dev
```

Or, build a production version:

```
npm run build
```

## Deploying to Github Pages

Deploy the built code to the `gh-pages` branch of a repository (NB then make sure to ensure you have switched on Github Pages in the remote (Github!) repository):

```
npm run deploy
```

NB, if you have made changes, remember to build and then deploy, e.g.:

```
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

NB there are some hardcoded paths in the code which you will need to change if you are hosting the files elsewhere.
